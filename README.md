## SDK Installation

To install this provider, copy and paste this code into your Terraform configuration. Then, run `terraform init`.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    airbyte = {
      source  = "aballiet/airbyte"
      version = "1.2.3"
    }
  }
}

provider "airbyte" {
  server_url = "http://localhost:8001/api/" # Must match your Airbyte server endpoint (airbyte-server-svc on k8s)
  username   = "YOUR_USERNAME"
  password   = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
  timeout    = 600 # 10 minutes - default is 60 seconds
}
```

## SDK Example Usage

### Testing the provider locally

Should you want to validate a change locally, the `--debug` flag allows you to execute the provider against a terraform instance locally.

This also allows for debuggers (e.g. delve) to be attached to the provider.

### Example

```sh
go run main.go --debug
# Copy the TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS env var
# In a new terminal
cd examples/your-example
TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS=... terraform init
TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS=... terraform apply
```

Terraform allows you to use local provider builds by setting a `dev_overrides` block in a configuration file called `.terraformrc`. This block overrides all other configured installation methods.

Terraform searches for the `.terraformrc` file in your home directory and applies any configuration settings you set.

```
provider_installation {

  dev_overrides {
      "registry.terraform.io/airbyte/scaffolding" = "<PATH>"
  }

  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```

Your `<PATH>` may vary depending on how your Go environment variables are configured. Execute `go env GOBIN` to set it, then set the `<PATH>` to the value returned. If nothing is returned, set it to the default location, `$HOME/go/bin`.
