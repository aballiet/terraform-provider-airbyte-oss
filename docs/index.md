  Airbyte Configuration API: Airbyte Configuration API
  https://airbyte.io https://airbyte.io.
  The Configuration API is an internal Airbyte API that is designed for communications between different Airbyte components.
  * It's main purpose is to enable the Airbyte Engineering team to configure the internal state of Airbyte Cloud https://airbyte.com/airbyte-cloud
  * It is also sometimes used by OSS users to configure their own Self-Hosted Airbyte deployment (internal state, etc)
  WARNING
  * Airbyte does NOT have active commitments to support this API long-term.
  * OSS users can utilize the Configuration API, but at their own risk.
  * This API is utilized internally by the Airbyte Engineering team and may be modified in the future if the need arises.
  * Modifications by the Airbyte Engineering team could create breaking changes and OSS users would need to update their code to catch up to any backwards incompatible changes in the API.

# aballiet-terraform-provider-airbyte-oss Provider

Airbyte Configuration API: Airbyte Configuration API
[https://airbyte.io](https://airbyte.io).

The Configuration API is an internal Airbyte API that is designed for communications between different Airbyte components.
* It's main purpose is to enable the Airbyte Engineering team to configure the internal state of [Airbyte Cloud](https://airbyte.com/airbyte-cloud)
* It is also sometimes used by OSS users to configure their own Self-Hosted Airbyte deployment (internal state, etc)

WARNING
* Airbyte does NOT have active commitments to support this API long-term.
* OSS users can utilize the Configuration API, but at their own risk.
* This API is utilized internally by the Airbyte Engineering team and may be modified in the future if the need arises.
* Modifications by the Airbyte Engineering team could create breaking changes and OSS users would need to update their code to catch up to any backwards incompatible changes in the API.

Authentication (OSS):
* When authenticating to the Configuration API, you must use Basic Authentication by setting username and password (which are `airbyte` and `password` by default).

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    airbyte = {
      source  = "aballiet/airbyte-oss"
      version = "1.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "airbyte" {
  server_url = "http://localhost:8001/api/" # Must match your Airbyte server endpoint (airbyte-server-svc on k8s)
  username   = "YOUR_USERNAME"
  password   = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
}
```

Below a full example with a custom connector : defining a `SourceDefintion`, `Source` and a `Connection` :

```hcl
locals {
  bq_destination_id = "e03724f5-987b-4f97-abf1-3ed54f3ea126"
}

data "airbyte_workspace" "default" {
  workspace_id = "3bd35192-80b7-40ff-82a7-956845321660"
}

# Here we are using the Slack official source connector
# But you can use any source connector you want from your own registry
resource "airbyte_source_definition" "slack" {
  source_definition = {
    name              = "Slack"
    docker_repository = "airbyte/source-slack"
    docker_image_tag  = "0.3.5"
    documentation_url = "https://api.slack.com/messaging/managing"
  }
  workspace_id = data.airbyte_workspace.default.workspace_id
}

# In the `connection_configuration` you can pass any configuration you want
# Based on the connector spec
# In this Slack example, configuration matches :
# https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-slack/source_slack/spec.json#L9
resource "airbyte_source" "slack" {
  connection_configuration = jsonencode({
    api_token       = "xoxb-1234567890-1234567890123-999999999999999999999"
    start_date      = "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    lookback_window = 7
    join_channels   = false
    channel_filter  = ["your-channel-name"]
  })
  name                 = "Slack"
  source_definition_id = airbyte_source_definition.slack.source_definition_id
  workspace_id         = data.airbyte_workspace.default.workspace_id
}

module "airbyte_connection" {
  source              = "aballiet/connection/airbyte"
  version             = "0.0.5"
  name                = "Slack Basic"
  status              = "active"
  workspace_id        = data.airbyte_workspace.default.workspace_id
  source_id           = airbyte_source.slack.source_id
  destination_id      = local.bq_destination_id
  destination_dataset = "airbyte_slack"
  normalize           = true

  schedule = {
    type = "basic"
    basic = {
      units     = 24
      time_unit = "hours"
    }
  }

  streams = [
    {
      name                  = "channel_members"
      destination_sync_mode = "overwrite"
      sync_mode             = "full_refresh"
    },
    {
      name                  = "users"
      destination_sync_mode = "overwrite"
      sync_mode             = "full_refresh"
    },
  ]
}
```
